I'm Md Jahid Hasan, a dedicated Web & WordPress Developer with 2 years of hands-on experience in WordPress and over 3 years in web development. I specialize in crafting dynamic, user-friendly websites with custom themes and page builders like Elementor, Divi, and WPBakery Builder. My focus is on delivering responsive, visually appealing, and high-performing websites tailored to client needs.

My expertise goes beyond frontend development—I'm also skilled in server migration, website optimization, and ongoing maintenance to ensure seamless site performance. I work comfortably within Linux-based environments and leverage my knowledge of the WordPress ecosystem to integrate custom functionality that aligns with business goals.

In addition to web development, I’m passionate about Linux system administration and DevOps. I bring practical experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios, along with automation tools like Ansible. I also have working knowledge of infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and virtualization, enabling me to streamline development workflows and manage scalable systems effectively.

I’m a problem solver at heart and thrive in both independent and collaborative settings. Always eager to learn and take on new challenges—let’s connect and build something impactful together!
